    themselves face the prospect of catastrophic consequences. Irrespective of the size, nature or purpose 
    of the business, the effects of a cyber attack can be devastating. What’s more, some of the highestprofile attacks over recent years have demonstrated how even the biggest companies in the world aren’t 
    always as well protected as they think they are. Even when their systems are brought back online and 
    business continues as normal, the reputational damage incurred can be much more difficult to 
    overcome. </p>

                    As far as general data security is concerned, there are two classifications of people – insiders and 
    outsiders (aka employees and non-employees). Figure Intro.1 shows the three classes of computer 
    security and crime caused by each of the two types, plus a special class of threats that are not directly 
    caused by humans, namely accidents.
